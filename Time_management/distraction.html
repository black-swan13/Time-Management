        <p class="p1">How to avoid getting distracted?    </p>
        <p class="p2">	Keep records. Write down the tasks you carry out at work and when distractions pop up in a log.</p>
        <p class="p2">	Block your time.</p>
        <p class="p2">	Limit your correspondence time. </p>
        <p class="p2">	Take breaks. </p>
        <p class="p2">	Complete one task at a time. </p>
        <p class="p2">	Control your smartphone. </p>
        <p class="p3">Make a schedule or to-do list
            Juggling multiple projects and deadlines at school can be stressful. When you're working on one assignment, it's easy to forget about another. You can help organize your deadlines and manage your time more efficiently with a proper schedule. One study suggests that the simple act of writing things out helps boost your concentration and memory.
            Turn off alerts
            Constant notifications and text messages are every college student's enemy. Put your phone on silent or in "Do Not Disturb" mode, and close unnecessary tabs on your computer. If you need the Internet, keep one tab open. You can fight online distractions by blocking or hiding time-wasting websites and apps.
            Break down your work into smaller tasks
            Defeat procrastination by breaking a large project into small pieces. It's easier to motivate yourself to do something in smaller tasks rather than jumping into a huge one. If you're having a difficult time studying or getting work done, break up your time effectively. Try giving yourself a 10-minute break for every 45–50 minutes of work you do. Studies show that taking breaks can help you retain information and increase productivity.
            Use headphones
            If you're working in a noisy environment, use noise-cancelling headphones. Listening to music through earbuds can also tune out distracting noises like people talking too loudly or construction work. Often, though, music with lyrics can be too distracting. Researchers suggest listening to classical or instrumental music to improve concentration.
            Find the right place to do work
            Some students work best with a little background noise, while others need complete quiet. Get to know your work style and the type of atmosphere you prefer. Are you the kind of person who works better in silence at the library? Or do you prefer the campus coffee shop with ambient noise? Try a few different spaces and see how each study session works out.
            Clear your desk
            Is your desk covered with stacks of papers? Is your computer monitor framed with layers of sticky notes? If so, it's time to get organized. A messy workspace can keep you from getting your work done. Go through your desk and keep only the essentials. A clean workspace can help reduce anxiety and make room for motivation.
            Reward yourself
            A little motivation can go a long way. Setting up a reward system is a good way to encourage yourself to do something. For example, if you finish an essay without any distractions, give yourself a reward like watching a video or taking a nap.
